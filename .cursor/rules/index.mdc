# Convexia Clarifier Repo Rules
- Use Supabase Edge Functions (Deno) to call OpenAI Responses API with reasoning.effort="high" and JSON Schema structured outputs.
- Store model output in table `asset_queries.llm_output` and set `status='clarified_pending_user'`.
- No secrets in code; all via env.
- Typescript-first; small, commented modules.
